Join a league

Private league – Create a league and share the unique code with anyone you want to join. You can choose when the league finishes and how many competitions are involved (maximum = five).
Public leagues – Take on the world by simply jumping into one of the many public leagues on Sportlobster. If you feel like you aren’t up to the challenge, you can leave any league at any time.
