My name is Cecil Lewis, and I am a survivor.  For weeks I daydreamed of my familyâ€™s vacation to Thailand.  That vacation was a much needed time away from my hectic hours as a lawyer in a medium-sized firm in Chicago.  But as it turned out my time there was not relaxing at all, life had a different plan.  While on that vacation, our hotel received word of a devastating tsunami set to hit land, we were to evacuate quickly.  Lucky for my family we were further uphill hiking that day when we heard the news. We left to find an even safer location just before the water came on shore. We survived the tsunami. It was an act of God. When we returned many days later we found our resort was no more.
